## Configure Redirect
This chapter describes how to configure HTTP redirect. This function will return a response with redirect code for the received request, indicating the client to redirect to a new URL.

## Enable Redirect
In conf/bfe.conf, enable the module
```ini
Modules = mod_redirect
```

## Configuration
The configuration is located in the directory conf/mod_redirect/, contains two files:

```
$ ls
mod_redirect.conf	redirect.data
```

mod_redirect.conf is the basic configuration file of the module, pointing to the redirect rule file. mod_redirect.conf usually does not need to be modified.

```
$ cat mod_redirect.conf 
[basic]
DataPath = mod_redirect/redirect.data
```

redirect.data contains redirect rules and can be loaded dynamically. The sample configuration file in the installation package is as follows:

```
{
    "Version": "1",
    "Config": {
        "example_product": [
            {
                "Cond": "req_path_prefix_in(\"/redirect\", false)",
                "Actions": [
                    {
                        "Cmd": "URL_SET",
                        "Params": ["https://example.org"]
                    }
                ],
                "Status": 301
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
The above configuration adds a rule to product *example_product*: for requests that meet the condition identified by "Cond" (the prefix of the request path is "/redirect"), execute the action identified by "Actions" (redirect to https://example.orgï¼‰, the returned HTTP response code is 301.

## Actions
"Cmd" in "Actions" indicates how to set the URL in redirect.

### URL_SET

```json

    "Params": ["http://www.example.com/more"]
}
```

### URL_FROM_QUERY

    "Cmd": "URL_FROM_QUERY",

}
```
